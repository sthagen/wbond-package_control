Version 4.2.0 Release Notes
===========================

IMPORTANT NOTICE!

  This is the last version with support for ST3.

NEW DEFAULT CHANNEL

  Package Control is using the following new default channel by default:

        https://packages.sublimetext.io/channel.json

  Any request to https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json is redirected.

  To discover packages online, visit

        https://packages.sublimetext.io

  New packages and libraries are published daily at 0:00 UTC.

  Dedicated libraries channel is still available, but its content is merged
  into new default channel and thus doesn't need to be specified explicitly.

  This change is required as packagecontrol.io is more or less unmaintained
  for several years, didn't even receive related Package Control 4 updates,
  suffered various even long lasting outages and its infrastructure seems to
  struggle with current amount of packages and data needed to be managed,
  which results in packages frequently not being available for install or
  upgrade. As current community doesn't have access to its infrastructure.

  The new crawler works way more efficient and uses a more intelligent
  caching strategy to reduce network bandwidth. Full downloads are only
  made if packages or libraries have been added or modified really changed.

  There's still some work to do to consolidate new infrastructure,
  which this change is a first and important step, for.

  The new crawler and website are maintained under:

        https://github.com/packagecontrol
